## Business problem
* Group training sessions are an integral part of what is offered by Athleta 24/7.
* Current maintenance requires manual editing of training sessions and timetable.
* Gym members sign up to these classes via phone or paper forms.
* Updates to timetable can be tedious & time consuming.
* Poor tracking of class statistics, such class attendance.
* Member bookings can be misplaced due to manual handling.

## Style Guide
### CSS framework
As the sole developer working on this project, the decision was made to use MUI-CSS to provide styled components in order to focus on learning the React library. MUI-CSS is also rich in features (component based) that easily integrate with React, which I think would enhance the user experience. MUI-CSS design is clean, minimal and flat, which fits in to my design aesthestic direction.

### Colour
The colours selected were based the client's existing website. Naturally, I decided the app should complement the client's chosen colour scheme.
