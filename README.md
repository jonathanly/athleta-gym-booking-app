## Style Guide
### CSS framework

The decision was made to use Material UI due to the rich features it offers (such as modals, cards, toggling) and our belief that it would enhance the user experience. Material UI allowed us to integrate the design with our React components.
The look and feel of Material also fits in with our design aesthestic, being clean, minimal and flat.
